  - Works across various DB technologies (e.g. replicate Oracle->MySQL)
  - Can enable validation (additional queries), validation rules (e.g. null same as space), "validate only" mode
  - Lots of CloudWatch metrics, including validation counts
  - Very similar to Attunity replicate:
    - Requires an (EC2) replication instance
    - Define endpoints and tasks
    - Task refs endpoints and can be "Migrate existing data" (full load), "Replicate data changes only" (changes), or "Migrate existing data and Replicate ongoing changes" (both)
    - Tasks can be running or stopped
- AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)
  - Replicate volumes directly into AWS
  - Creates AMIs
  - NOTE To integrate create CloudWatch event rule for SMS job state changes https://docs.aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/latest/userguide/cwe-sms.html

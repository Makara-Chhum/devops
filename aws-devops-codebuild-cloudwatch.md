- Logs - Under CodeBuild > Logs - set up log groups - only trace of build after it's finished
  - CloudWatch logs
  - S3
- Metrics - can create a dashboard or create an alarm which triggers an event
  - Succeeded, failed, overall builds sum
  - Duration of each stage, CPU
  - E.g. too many failures, create an alarm
  - too many failures
  - too many overall builds - maybe there's a bug with the build process
- Events - most important integration with CodeBuild - now Amazon EventBridge - two most important
  - 1. How do you schedule events over time? Maybe run it every hour
  - Rules - either an Event pattern or a Schedule
  - Targets - e.g. CodeBuild project
  - The basis for automation - Can build based on CodeBuild state changes
  - More complex can use CodePipeline

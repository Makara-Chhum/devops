KEY IDEA Comparing Compliance solutions
- AWS Config
  - Ensure EC2 instance has proper AWS configuration (not open SSH port)
  - Audit and compliance over time
  - Automation and remediation with CloudWatch or directly
- Inspector
  - Will not launch instances (must exist) but it can install Inspector agent if SSM agent exists
  - Security vulnerability scan within OS with agent
  - Or outside network scanning
- Systems Manager SSM
  - Run automations, patches, commands, inventory at scale
- Service Catalog
  - Restrict how instances can be launched
  - Make sure beginners don't make mistakes
- Configuration Management tools
  - SSM, OpsWorks, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, userdata
  - Q: CloudFormation?
  - Ensure EC2 instances have proper configuration files

AWS Data Protection
- TLS for encryption in transit
  - AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to manage certificates
  - Load Balancers
    - ELB, ALB, NLB provide SSL termination
    - Can have multiple certificates per ALB
    - Optional encryption between ALB and EC2 instances (normally HTTP)
  - CloudFront with SSL certificates
  - All AWS services expose HTTPS
  - You could (but SHOULDN'T) use plain HTTP API - everything else HTTPS
- Encryption at rest
  - S3 Encryption
    - SSE-S3 Standard encryption using AWS' key
	- SSE-KMS
	- SSE-C - client side (AWS doesn't keep it, but encrypts with it)
	- Client side encryption - AWS never sees the key
	- Can set default encryption
	- Can enforce encryption in S3 bucket policy
	- Glacier encrypted by default
  - For EBS, EFS, RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, etc
    - Either service encryption key or your own KMS key
  - Category of data - very strong encryption and security requirements
    - PHI - protected health info
	- PII - personal identifying info

Network Protection
- Direct Connect - private, direct connection
- Public Internet: Use VPN (on-premise to cloud)
  - Site-to-site VPN w/ IPSec
- Network ACL - stateless firewall at VPC level
- WAF - web security rules against common exploits
  - Deploy on CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway, or AWS AppSync (GraphQL APIs)
- Security groups - stateful firewall on instance's underlying hypervisor
- System firewalls - you can set up your own Linux or Windows firewall

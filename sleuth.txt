Sleuth - Accelerate metrics
- Deployment rate = Frequency, times/day
  - Can we deploy frequency vs Do we
- Lead Time
  - Code from initial merge to production
  - Basic: track jira tickets - but don't show whole picture
  - Could be misleading because of parts of tickets
- MTTR
  - Tracked manually, so only look at the worst examples
  - Many things done quickly, but these don't show up
- Change Failure Rate
  - Failed deployments, code rollbacks

Sleuth integrations
- Deployment rate - Sleuth API - you send the SHA for deployment
- Change Lead Time - GitHub SHA Tracking - can compare deployment time's API call vs commit
- MTTR 
  - CloudWatch, NR, Datadog
  - Tries to make inferences based on GitHub (commit undos) - Time to next commit and everything healthy again
  - Better if integrate metrics and alarms
  - Can help move forward with metrics being forwarded - e.g. 500's in API
- Change Failure Rate - Code rollback identification
- Metadata

Can customize environment using saved configs
- But also create .ebextensions files IN PROJECT ROOT that give further environment configs
- File names *.config - really YAML
- option_settings section - autoscaling configs, instance types, custom image, security groups, etc.
  - Two syntaxes - listed key/value array, or e.g. aws:autoscaling:asg
  - just do an `eb deploy` to redeploy

Can also use CloudFormation template language directly (`Resources` block)
- You can output names/ARNs
- Can also use together with option_settings section to set environment variables -> pass to the application - really great for autogenerated names e.g. SNS topic names
  Weird syntax:
    option_settings:
      aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
        # these are assigned dynamically during a deployment
        NOTIFICATION_TOPIC: '`{"Ref" : "NotificationTopic"}`'
        DYNAMODB_TABLE: '`{"Ref" : "DynamoDBTable"}`'
        AWS_REGION: '`{"Ref" : "AWS::Region"}`'
  - When deployed onto instance, they will be resolved 
  - /opt/elasticbeanstalk/bin/get-config environment
  - /opt/elasticbeanstalk/bin/get-config optionsettings

Note that this DynamoDB table and SNS topic part of CloudFormation
- KEY IDEA: if you want lifecycle to not be linked to EB lifecycle, create it externally
- they are tied to the environment - another environment gets another
- delete environment -> delete resources
- so for external/permanent tables etc. don't make part of the EB environment
- options
  - 1) Create it manually and just reference it by name in the eb environment properties
  - 2) External CloudFormation

Other random commands
  - create separate .ebextensions files for commands
  - commands specified in YAML map, run in alphabetic order by name
  - will redeploy a new instance version - so they are run in a fresh environment
  - KEY IDEA: Two kinds of command blocks - commands and container_commands
    - commands: run commands on the EC2, runs BEFORE APPLICATION AND WEB SERVER SET UP - set up files and packages
    - container_commands: commands that affect application source code - run AFTER APPLICATION/WEB SERVER SET UP but BEFORE application deployed
    - Sequence
      - commands
      - application/web server setup
      - version archive extracted
      - container_commands - common use cases
        - modify index.html to have timestamp or version info
        - do database migrations
        - KEY IDEA: have `leader_only: true` option - only run on the single "leader" instance - only for container_commands

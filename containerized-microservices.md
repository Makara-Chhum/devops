Containerized Microservices Whitepaper
- "Architectural and organizational approach to development - small, independent services via well-defined APIs"
- Monolith - one big piece, all updated at once
- Microservices
  - Decoupled
  - Single function - authenticating a user, shopping cart, checkout - smaller you break up the better
  - Well-defined APIs - others don't need to know anything about the microservice
  - 12-Factor app
    - Isolate dependencies - don't share any dependencies
	- Ephemeral - disposable, doesn't store state
	- Scalability - scale out, concurrency - write to ensure
- Organization structure
  - Must have autonomous teams - developing, managing, monitoring
  - Own microservice all the way to production to support
- Product, not project
  - For a project, you only do what you need to
  - For a product, you need to do everything needed to make successful 
    - delivery automation
	- self-service (both users and developers, don't have to ask people for logs, etc.)
	- continuously integrated - no big merges and feature jumps
	- continuously delivery - always push it out, customer sees the value sooner
- Smart endpoints, dumb pipes
  - Don't overcomplicate the communication method (no ESB)
- Decentralized governance
  - Freedom to choose dependencies
  - Freedom to choose build tools - they're the ones building and supporting the pipeline
  - Freedom to choose data tools - use any database you want and best suited for your service
  - No shared data sources - no schema coordination, etc.
- Design for failure
  - Disposable - can replace at any time
  - Resiliency - Latency and timeouts expected
  - Able to failover to another region
  - Self-healing - in old days sys admins needed to go in manually - now often just kill the old one and start new ones
  - Treats logs as event streams, isolated from the environment

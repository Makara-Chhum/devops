- Buckets can define events - don't need to enable anything in particular
- Different than CloudWatch events
  - KEY IDEA Can set up "events" to SNS, SQS, or Lambda
  - Don't need to enable anything - for CloudWatch you also need to enable CloudTrail for the bucket to get the eveets
  - PUT, POST, COPY, delete, multipart upload completed, etc
- Bucket policy works together with IAM permissions - UNION of policies apply
  - KEY IDEA Need bucket policy to allow CloudTrail access to the bucket
- Can Replicate a bucket in same account or different, same or cross-region
  - Entire bucket
  - Or prefix or tags
  - Can change storage class, change ownership
  - Has to assign an IAM role
  - Asynchronous replication
  - NOTE Glacier doesn't replicate
- Lifecycle rule - save same money
  - Prefix, current and/or old versions
  - E.g transition to glacier or standard-IA after 90 days
  - Automatic delete objects after a period of time (expire)
- Encryption
  - Server-side encryption - None, AES (S3 key), or own KMS key (most common)
  - Client-side encryption
  - SSE-C - client provides the key
- Access logs
  - Put access logs into another bucket
  - Query using Athena to visualize the data, look for bad requests
